# tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe GUI game

Built a Tic Tac Toe game in Python using Tkinter to create a GUI for the game. 
You press the button to select the spot you want. It switches from player X to Player O each round. 

Some updates I want to add:
-A label saying whose turn it is currently
-A label that asks to play again after you win
